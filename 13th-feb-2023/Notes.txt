--> Class Component:- 
    A react component which we make with the help of class or using the "class" keyword.

    So, to make a class react we use Component class from react Library.
    Here we use inheritance. We inherit some properties of Component class into our Component.

    State and props :- 
    ==> State
        State is a react Object which we use to store some data or information about the component.
        We can use the state only in the particular component.
        We can't use that state outside of that component.
        State informs the Virtual Dom (React DOM) the information or data related to component.
        If there are some changes in the state than state will inform the Virtual DOM that there are some changes in the Component.
        Virtual DOM than compare and re-paint the component.

    ==> Props
        We can pass props from one Component to Another Component.
        Props are Uni-directonal.
        Props Travel from Parent to Child.
        We can't Change the value of Props.

    ==> Prop Drilling :- 
        The process of transferring of data from one component to another component is a DOM tree is known as props drilling.

Koi Component



==> Read, write and append 
Read :- We can only read/use the value;
Write :- We can assign the new value to it.
Append:- We can add some more data into the value;

let a = 'Hello';
console.log(a); // Read
a = 'Hello2' // Write
a += 'Hello' // 'Hello2 Hello' Append






-> To import any component or functions into another file/Component we have to export the function or component from that file.
-> We can export the function or component in two ways :- 
    1. By using export default.
    2. By exporting all the function/Components as a Object.

While importing the Component or function.
    1. If we are exporting using default than we can directly import it like :- 
    import Main from 'Component/Main';

    2. If we are exporting all as a Object.
        a. We should destructure it from the file.
            import { Main, Main1, Main2 } from 'Component/Main';
        b. We should import all as any Identifier (Name);
            import * as Mains from 'Component/Main';
